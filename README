Requirements: Drupal CVS

A module containing helper functions for Drupal developers and 
inquisitive admins. Initially, this module prints out a summary of
all database queries for each page request at the bottom of each page. The
summary includes how many times each query was executed on a page 
(shouldn't run same query multiple times), and how long each query
 took (short is good - use cache for complex queries).

Also a dprint_r($array) function is provided, which pretty prints arrays. Useful during 
development.

Please contribute your own useful functions. Just edit and commit this module when you 
get the urge. No need to submit a patch!
